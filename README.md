MindCare AI is an intelligent mental health assessment and support system. It combines traditional Machine Learning (SVM) for clinical risk prediction with a Large Language Model (Llama 3 via Groq) to provide empathetic, conversational support.
The system analyzes user biometrics (sleep, stress, age) to predict depression risk and then engages in a supportive dialogue, offering personalized motivation, nutritional advice, and spiritual comfort.
